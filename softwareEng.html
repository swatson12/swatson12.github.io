		<h3>About the class:</h3>
		<p>Software Engineering at Otago Polytechnic is a second year course, made to give students experience in designing and creating software in groups and as closely as it would happen in the industry.</p><p>At the start of the semester, Meals on Wheels came to our lecturer to see if we could create something that would make it easier to run their day to day business of delivering, making, and organising meals. </p><br>
		<h3>Overview of what I did:</h3>
		<p><ul>
			<li>Set up the database</li>
			<li>Figured out how to use Sequelize for the ORM</li>
			<li>Got data being added to the database through the site</li>
			<li>Set up routes on the server and pages on the site to be able to add drivers and link customers to drivers</li>
			<li>Put in feedback for when something has been added to the database</li>
		</ul></p>

		<h3>The story:</h3>
		<p> My first task with three or four others was to come up with some sort of database schema that would be able to hold all the different types of data we needed to store and access. This was a confusing couple of weeks, trying to work out what the business actually did and trying to not over do it with all the different tables and parts. </p><p>At about week three or four we had a basic schema we could put into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping" title="About ORMs" target="_blank"> Object Relational Model (ORM)</a>. The ORM we decided to use was <i>Sequelize</i>, an ORM for node.js that uses JavaScript objects with key:value pairs to define tables and fields. The point of ORMs are so you essentially define how the database should be used with any type of database dialects (such as MySQL, PostgrSQL, SQLite, MongoDB). For our project we were using MySQL, so the ORM builds a MySQL database, if it isn't already created. Figuring out how Sequelize works took a long time. No one in the class had ever used it before so it was a giant learning curve to find out how it works and how to use it. We spent a lot of time reading and discussing the <a href="http://docs.sequelizejs.com/" title="Sequelize documentation" target="_blank">documentation</a>, examples and what bits of code go where to successfully build our database.</p>
		<p>After what felt like ages trying to get the ORM working and trying to understand Sequelize, it finally all clicked and we had a server that when it ran, it created a MySQL database if it didn't already exist. We then moved on to working out how to use the ORM in other .js files we had and add to that database. Adon was a miracle worker and worked it all out, so he was able to tell me how whatever it was should be started and then left me to figure out how it should connect all together.
