			<h3>The essay:</h3>
			<p>
				There are so many stories and articles abput women experiencing sexism in the IT industry that it makes it hard and very infuriating to read and do research on. This essay will be touching on some statistics related to women and sexism in IT, how it's not only men creating the sexism environments and the "brogrammer" culture that exists.
			</p>
			<p>
				Researching statistics on women in IT is difficult, as nearly every statistic is from the U.K. or U.S.A., which doesn't reflect how it is in New Zealand. The statistics that were found are a few years old (2012-2013) but they still give a pretty good idea of how it is is for women in IT and how underrepresented they are.<br>In 2012, 62,252 people were employed in IT related occupations. Of these 62 thousand-odd, just 25% were women. Reports say that the amount of women in IT is rising, but there are also reports that say it's declining. With just 1 in 5 IT graduates across the country being women in 2015, it doesn't seem to be changing much.
			</p>
			<p>
				Reading stories on women experiencing sexism is really hard, it makes you feel awful for the women going through it and you can only hope it isn't going to happen to you. For every three or four articles on how a woman was excelling in her IT position was fired, resigned, or even demoted only to have the replacement to be a severly underqualified man who more than likely is being paid more, there are stories of a woman telling another woman that there's nothing to be done about the sexist culture. Most recently this happened at Uber, the ridesharing company. A female manager was recruiting a female software engineer to work in app development. The software engineer was excited for the opportunity until she read further into the company and the news around Uber, mostly in regards to the previous sexism stories and "questionable business practices." The engineer had messaged the recruiter, through LinkedIn, to say she no longer had any interest in joining the company. The response the engineer got from the manager included the statement of "sexism is systematic in tech." Even though Uber has had some serious PR issues all year, the stories about sexism in the company and what the company isn't doing to prevent or eradicate it, seems to be one of the main things people in the industry are getting most upset and horrified at.
			</p>
			<p>
				What became really apparent while researching was the existence of a culture in software companies that people have dubbed "brogrammers." "Brogrammers" are essentially are clique of privileged, mostly white males within a company that make the environment awful for anyone to work in. In some cases the sexism and culture has resulted in women leaving the company. Just recently, the creater of Minecraft, Markus Perrson, had seen a screenshot of a tweet female video game developer, Zoe Quinn had posted. In the tweet, Quinn had said "I am 100% for never letting it go when a developer participated in GamerGate." Persson replied to the tweet containing the screenshot by calling Quinn an extremely offensive and derogatory term. Quinn responded with "I love making video games" with the sarcasm intended not being subtle. Perrson might be a known Twitter "troll" but in no context is it appropriate, regardless of sex. Quinn didn't even work with Persson and she had to deal with the brogrammer culture, that would definitely have been very prominent in Perrson's Minecraft offices.
			</p>
			<p>
				To conclude, sexism is so prevaliant in software engineering and IT that there is a very successful blog dedicated to publishing women's stories of sexism. If that doesn't make it obvious that there needs to be change, what will?
