        <p>This portfolio came to be because I had to make one for Software Engineering in the first semester of 2017. I spent a night making the inital design with the home page and how all the pages are laid out. Ever since I made it, I've just been adding to it and refining it to make it as good as possible. I have also made it responsive, so I can view it on my iPhone with no issues. </p>
        <p>I designed the website to have borders that don't connect because I had made a decision that I didn't like the way it looked when they were connected, it made it feel too boxed in and rigid. The disconnected lines makes it feel less constrained to me. </p>

        function responsive_menu() {
            var x = document.getElementById("nav");
            if (x.className === "n"||x.className==="dropdown") {
                console.log(x.className);
                    x.className += " responsive";
            } else {
                    x.className = "n";
            }
        }

        function dropitems(){
            var x=document.getElementById("dropitems");
                console.log(x.classList.contains("dropitems"));
        }
