			I chose the pirate port image to base my soundscape on. I could imagine what sounds and effects I wanted to use, just by looking at it. I used sounds I recorded myself (the birds in the background, the walking, the occassional gust of wind) and sounds I downloaded from <a href="www.soundbible.com">soundbible.com</a>.
			<p>When I was making the soundscape, I put all the files I recorded into Audacity to see how they fit together and if they were going to work with achieving the sound of a pirate port. I had about 7 different audio clips I had recorded from different areas of Dunedin and ended up using 5 of them. </p><p>With a couple of the sound files, both recorded and downloaded from SoundBible, I had edited them so they were slightly longer than they were orginally, mainly because I wanted to have the sound in the background for an extended time, rather than the 20 seconds or however long the file was initially. In a couple of the longer files, I made the volume of them increase and decrease to make it feel like the soundscape isn't a huge wall of noise. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I didn't do too much editing of the files except for placing shorter files such as the Anvil Impact, and the Boat Horn around different places that I felt fit the soundscape. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the first version of the soundscape, at the very end I had a cannon go off really loudly, which I thought was pretty funny at the time, but after hearing the rest of the class' soundscapes, I took it out as it was definitely not appropriate.
