              <ol>
                  <li>How often do you attend scheduled group meetings/scrums? <!--5/5--></li><p>
                        I attended every meeting and scrum, unless I was ill, had a client meeting scheduled at the same time or something unexpected came up. I found that when I did miss a meeting for whatever reason, I missed an important change or decision so I made sure I went to every meeting possible.
                  </p><br>
                  <li>How well did you communicate with others in your group or subgroup? <!--5/5--></li><p>
                        We set up a Slack channel for our communication so we had a common place to ask questions, post photos of whiteboards and follow up on various things. This proved to be extremely helpful as most of the time not all of us were in the project room at the same time so if we needed anything, we could just message each other on Slack. During the IoT Database task, we linked our Trello board to Slack so we got notified each time someone made a change on the Trello board. We also sat near each other in the project room so it was easy to turn around and ask the other a question or talk about the task if need be. <br><div class="grid">

                  </p><br>
                  <li>How well did you document your work throughout the project?<!--2.5/5--></li><p>
                    Documentation isn’t my strong suit and because of this I didn’t do a whole lot of it this semester. I commented my code where needed, wrote a data dictionary and API endpoints for the OAR API, and a How To for the layout files in the AYA app(see evidence of these below). I’m very aware I could have completed a lot more documentation and I’m going to try next semester to write more. 
                    </p><br>
                  <li>How well did you respond to problems or changing requirements? <!--4/5--></li><p>
                        There was always a bit of initial confusion and internalised annoyance, but I always just accepted it, and made the changes or worked to fix the problem. Two most memorable times requirements changed were with the IoT Database and with OAR. With the IoT Database, at the start of the second week working on it, it was decided that we didn’t need the three weeks assigned, so we had to get it completed by the end of the week. After the first panic of “we have a lot to do in 4 days,” we got to work and worked hard to make the shortened deadline. We made the deadline and we were proud of the work we produced. After I’d spent just over a week making an API for Otago Access Radio, they decided , they wanted to go back to their original idea of having an app, and not use the API.  This effectively made the API I’d been working on irrelevant. for the future. It was annoying, but I finished the documentation I’d been working on and commented the code I’d written and now it’s in the GitHub repo, waiting to be potentially used next semester.

                        <li>What is the overall quality of your code like?</li><p> <!--3.5/5-->
                        The quality of my code has definitely improved since the start of the semester. For instance, during the squash app development, I didn’t plan anything and threw code at the wall hoping it would stick. Even though the AYA app was only the next task, I feel like my code improved immensely, it was more modular and easier to read.
                        <!--Get examples from squash and aya apps--></p></br>
                        
                        <li>How well did you follow best practices in development?</li><p><!-- 4/5-->
                        When we were doing the two tasks (AYA and IoT Database) as a group, we tried to follow best practices as well as possible to avoid confusion about what everyone had to do and where it was happening. With the AYA app we didn’t do it so well - we had a whiteboard with a list of tasks and activities that had to be completed by the due date and we assigned them to ourselves which we then ticked off as we completed them. We tested where appropriate, mostly after writing a bit of code to get the main functionality and then testing if we’d made a fix and needed to check it was working. With version control, we didn’t do very well, we used GitHub but we figured since we were working on explicitly different parts of the app, we didn’t need to make our own branches of the app and have a pull request to a master branch when we’d completed an activity or task. This wasn’t great because nearly every time any of us committed to git, there was a merge conflict. Taking the challenges from the AYA app we made a few improvements and had a different way of doing things with IoT Database. We still used the whiteboard at the start to sort out the tasks that were involved and to divide them up, but we then put that on a Trello board so anyone could see what was in progress, completed and who was doing what. On our group’s GitHub, we set up a master branch for the API and then we each an individual branch that we worked on and then made a pull request when we completed a major change. This was so much better than before with the AYA app, it was a lot easier to have a better work flow by being that more organised and everyone was less confused.

                        <li>How well did you use appropriate version control? </li><!--4/5--><p>
                        For each task, except the Oculus (the files were too big to be pushed to GitHub), there was always a branch on the CommSoftTasks GitHub repo that was made to push work to. As outlined in the previous question, we used GitHub a lot with the group tasks and I used it for the ones we did individually too. I found it helpful to do regular commits so if I forgot to write what I did for a couple of days, I could go back through the git commits, with usually good commit messages, to see what had been completed those days. <br>

                        <li>To what extent do you think you contributed an equal portion of the overall project? <!--4/5--></li><p>The projects we worked on as a group were great; we all collectively agreed on tasks that we could do, made sure they were evenly split up and we all got them completed. If one person was struggling with their part of the task, the other two would help by either doing some pair programming or by taking on one of the other tasks they hadn’t completed yet. We all also have our own strengths that we were aware of and we optimised them to get the task completed to a pretty good standard. I feel that although I haven’t taken as many advanced programming courses as some of the other people in my group, I still contributed my fair amount. I did a lot of the frontend development and design, making sure the software we made worked well and looked good. I also did was the point person for the Otago Access Radio, trying to keep up with what they were wanting and keeping them happy. </p>
